# Weather-Challenge


## Description

The goal of this project is to create a weather app for each city so travelers are able to check the weather before each travel. 


## Usage

The way this webside can be used is by typing the name of the city that you are traveling to, and you will be guided to a page that displays the weather for the week. It will have images of the weather type, the temperature, and a description regarding the weather.
